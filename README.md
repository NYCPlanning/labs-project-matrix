# Labs Project Matrix
A matrix of potential Labs projects visualizing impact, breadth, difficulty, and beneficiary

It's just a D3.js scatter plot and an associated JSON file with an object for each potential project.  It's [hosted on github pages](https://nycplanning.github.io/labs-project-matrix/).
